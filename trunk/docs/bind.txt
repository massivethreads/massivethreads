== Bind workers to CPU ==

If environment variable MYTH_BIND_WORKERS is set to 0,
MassiveThreads does NOT bind workers to CPUs.

Otherwise it binds workers to CPUs.

In this case, if environment variable MYTH_CPU_LIST is set,
it specifies CPU numbers workers are bound to.  For example,

MYTH_CPU_LIST=3,5,7,9

worker 0 is bound to CPU 3,
worker 1 is bound to CPU 5,
worker 2 is bound to CPU 7,
worker 3 is bound to CPU 9,
worker 4 is bound to CPU 3,
worker 5 is bound to CPU 5,
worker 6 is bound to CPU 7,
worker 7 is bound to CPU 9,
  ...

If workers are bound to CPUs but MYTH_CPU_LIST is not given,
worker 0 is bound to CPU 0, worker 1 is bound to CPU 1, ...

The full syntax of MYTH_CPU_LIST is as follows.

cpu_list ::= range[,range]*
range    ::= num[-num[:num]]

range A-B is a shorthand of A,A+1,...,B-1.
range A-B:C is a short hand of A,A+C,A+2C,...,A+kC
where k is the larget number s.t. A+kC < B.
